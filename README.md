# Hi, Iâ€™m Christine! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer with a background in STEM. I'm enthusiastic about creating responsive, fast, and user-friendly websites that combine design with functionality, and I'm always learning new techniques to produce more interactive and visually engaging web applications.<br><br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning **React** and expanding my knowledge of **JavaScript** to create more complex, interactive web applications.
- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy experimenting with libraries like **Chart.js** and **GSAP** to add data visualizations and animations to my projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on improving my knowledge of **React hooks** and **state management**.
